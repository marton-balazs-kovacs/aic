I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 5.09/1.45 & 4.92/1.37 & 4.78/1.58 & 4.92/1.36 & 4.82/1.55 & 0.27 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 5.18/1.47 & 4.85/1.3 & 4.96/1.28 & 4.76/1.44 & 5/1.17 & 0.18 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 4.55/1.51 & 4.28/1.57 & 4.28/1.69 & 4.19/1.59 & 4.71/1.61 & -0.16 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 4.64/1.43 & 4.64/1.36 & 4.55/1.55 & 4.54/1.42 & 4.76/1.48 & -0.12 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 4.82/1.78 & 5.36/1.46 & 5.26/1.39 & 5.41/1.44 & 5.18/1.55 & -0.36 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 4.55/1.63 & 4.69/1.32 & 4.5/1.44 & 4.36/1.27 & 4.76/1.15 & -0.21 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 4.18/1.47 & 4.39/1.4 & 4.3/1.57 & 4.59/1.23 & 4.59/1.42 & -0.41 \\
