I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 4.82/1.45 & 4.89/1.43 & -0.07 & 4.79/1.43 & 5.21/1.34 & -0.42 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 4.98/1.3 & 4.85/1.3 & 0.13 & 4.82/1.42 & 4.57/1.37 & 0.25 \\
