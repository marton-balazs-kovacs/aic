I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 5/1.15 & 4.68/1.34 & 5.23/1.53 & 4.75/1.38 & 4.46/1.13 & 0.54 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 4.14/1.35 & 4.76/1.22 & 5.13/1.37 & 4.95/1.25 & 3.92/1.38 & 0.22 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 4/1.15 & 3.9/1.48 & 4.7/1.72 & 4.58/1.47 & 3.46/1.2 & 0.54 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 4.29/1.25 & 4.29/1.3 & 4.97/1.49 & 4.67/1.38 & 4.38/1.56 & -0.09 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 4.29/1.7 & 5.09/1.46 & 5.69/1.42 & 5.4/1.26 & 4.38/1.5 & -0.09 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 4.57/1.13 & 4.39/1.31 & 4.85/1.45 & 4.65/1.19 & 3.85/0.9 & 0.72 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 4.57/1.51 & 4.12/1.4 & 4.66/1.45 & 4.6/1.33 & 4.15/1.07 & 0.42 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 5.71/1.25 & 5.56/1.4 & 5.75/1.63 & 5.85/1.22 & 4.77/1.54 & 0.94 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 3.86/1.95 & 3.82/1.73 & 4.56/1.87 & 4.16/1.52 & 4/1.63 & -0.14 \\
