I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 5.5/0.71 & 5.25/1.16 & 0.25 & 4.76/1.45 & 4.98/1.4 & -0.22 & 5.14/1.39 & 4.65/1.62 & 0.49 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 3/2.83 & 4.5/1.41 & -1.50 & 4.95/1.26 & 4.83/1.32 & 0.12 & 5.14/1.52 & 4.76/1.25 & 0.38 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 2/0 & 3.88/1.55 & -1.88 & 4.38/1.66 & 4.18/1.55 & 0.20 & 4.82/1.56 & 4.24/1.44 & 0.58 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 2.5/0.71 & 4/1.51 & -1.50 & 4.78/1.42 & 4.45/1.42 & 0.33 & 4.73/1.42 & 4.76/1.15 & -0.03 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 5.5/0.71 & 4.88/1.46 & 0.62 & 5.34/1.45 & 5.29/1.42 & 0.05 & 5.5/1.44 & 5.24/1.86 & 0.26 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 2.5/0.71 & 4.12/1.73 & -1.62 & 4.69/1.34 & 4.55/1.29 & 0.14 & 4.82/1.44 & 4.06/1.25 & 0.76 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 3/1.41 & 3.75/1.58 & -0.75 & 4.51/1.33 & 4.26/1.46 & 0.25 & 5.05/1.43 & 4.41/1.33 & 0.64 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 4.5/2.12 & 5.25/1.04 & -0.75 & 5.75/1.42 & 5.52/1.5 & 0.23 & 5.68/1.84 & 6.12/1.22 & -0.44 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 2/0 & 3.38/1.85 & -1.38 & 4.19/1.68 & 4.09/1.87 & 0.10 & 4.82/1.3 & 4.12/2.09 & 0.70 \\
