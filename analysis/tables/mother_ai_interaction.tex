I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 4.76/1.28 & 4.61/1.39 & 0.15 & 5.3/1.5 & 5.16/1.58 & 0.14 & 4.77/1.58 & 4.72/1.19 & 0.05 & 4.12/1.13 & 5/1 & -0.88 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 4.64/1.21 & 4.86/1.24 & -0.22 & 5.09/1.41 & 5.17/1.35 & -0.08 & 4.88/1.34 & 5/1.2 & -0.12 & 3.5/1.07 & 4.6/1.67 & -1.10 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 3.78/1.37 & 3.99/1.56 & -0.21 & 4.7/1.65 & 4.71/1.81 & -0.01 & 4.73/1.34 & 4.45/1.59 & 0.28 & 3.38/1.06 & 3.6/1.52 & -0.22 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 4.25/1.19 & 4.32/1.38 & -0.07 & 4.88/1.51 & 5.07/1.47 & -0.19 & 4.81/1.33 & 4.55/1.43 & 0.26 & 4.25/1.49 & 4.6/1.82 & -0.35 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 5.09/1.48 & 5.1/1.45 & -0.01 & 5.77/1.48 & 5.6/1.36 & 0.17 & 5.19/1.33 & 5.59/1.18 & -0.40 & 3.62/1.41 & 5.6/0.55 & -1.98 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 4.44/1.33 & 4.35/1.3 & 0.09 & 4.84/1.53 & 4.86/1.37 & -0.02 & 4.85/1.01 & 4.48/1.33 & 0.37 & 3.62/0.74 & 4.2/1.1 & -0.58 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 4.07/1.4 & 4.15/1.4 & -0.08 & 4.79/1.45 & 4.53/1.45 & 0.26 & 4.65/1.23 & 4.55/1.43 & 0.10 & 3.88/1.13 & 4.6/0.89 & -0.72 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 5.31/1.51 & 5.75/1.29 & -0.44 & 5.68/1.84 & 5.81/1.41 & -0.13 & 5.69/1.26 & 6/1.2 & -0.31 & 4.12/1.46 & 5.8/1.1 & -1.68 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 3.71/1.67 & 3.9/1.78 & -0.19 & 4.6/1.92 & 4.52/1.85 & 0.08 & 4.23/1.27 & 4.1/1.74 & 0.13 & 3.75/1.58 & 4.4/1.82 & -0.65 \\
