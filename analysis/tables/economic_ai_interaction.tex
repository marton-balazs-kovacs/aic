I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 4.33/0.58 & 5.71/0.95 & -1.38 & 4.94/1.39 & 4.8/1.47 & 0.14 & 5/1.76 & 4.85/1.23 & 0.15 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 4/0 & 4.29/2.06 & -0.29 & 4.74/1.35 & 5.04/1.21 & -0.30 & 5.11/1.41 & 4.85/1.42 & 0.26 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 3/1 & 3.71/1.8 & -0.71 & 4.24/1.54 & 4.33/1.67 & -0.09 & 4.74/1.33 & 4.4/1.7 & 0.34 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 3/0 & 4/1.73 & -1.00 & 4.58/1.39 & 4.67/1.46 & -0.09 & 4.84/1.26 & 4.65/1.35 & 0.19 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 3.67/1.53 & 5.57/0.79 & -1.90 & 5.25/1.53 & 5.38/1.35 & -0.13 & 5.42/1.61 & 5.35/1.66 & 0.07 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 3/1 & 4.14/1.86 & -1.14 & 4.64/1.34 & 4.62/1.3 & 0.02 & 4.74/1.41 & 4.25/1.37 & 0.49 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 2.67/0.58 & 4/1.63 & -1.33 & 4.41/1.39 & 4.37/1.41 & 0.04 & 4.95/1.39 & 4.6/1.43 & 0.35 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 5.33/1.15 & 5/1.29 & 0.33 & 5.39/1.62 & 5.87/1.25 & -0.48 & 6/1.67 & 5.75/1.55 & 0.25 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 2/1 & 3.57/1.81 & -1.57 & 4.12/1.74 & 4.16/1.81 & -0.04 & 4.74/1.48 & 4.3/1.89 & 0.44 \\
