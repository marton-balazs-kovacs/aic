I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 5.33/0.82 & 4.8/2.05 & 0.53 & 4.99/1.3 & 4.86/1.44 & 0.13 & 5.03/1.67 & 4.59/1.5 & 0.44 & 4.69/1.51 & 5.13/1.17 & -0.44 & 4.73/1.62 & 5/1.55 & -0.27 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 5.5/1.05 & 4.8/1.92 & 0.70 & 4.7/1.32 & 4.99/1.27 & -0.29 & 4.97/1.36 & 4.95/1.24 & 0.02 & 4.62/1.5 & 4.9/1.4 & -0.28 & 4.64/1.29 & 5.67/0.52 & -1.03 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 4.5/1.38 & 4.6/1.82 & -0.10 & 4.22/1.48 & 4.34/1.66 & -0.12 & 4.44/1.74 & 4.16/1.67 & 0.28 & 4.1/1.47 & 4.27/1.72 & -0.17 & 4.55/1.51 & 5/1.9 & -0.45 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 5/1.1 & 4.2/1.79 & 0.80 & 4.62/1.24 & 4.66/1.47 & -0.04 & 4.59/1.72 & 4.52/1.44 & 0.07 & 4.45/1.38 & 4.63/1.47 & -0.18 & 4.36/1.5 & 5.5/1.22 & -1.14 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 4.5/1.87 & 5.2/1.79 & -0.70 & 5.16/1.57 & 5.54/1.34 & -0.38 & 5.38/1.52 & 5.18/1.3 & 0.20 & 5.66/1.37 & 5.17/1.49 & 0.49 & 4.73/1.62 & 6/1.1 & -1.27 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 4.83/1.6 & 4.2/1.79 & 0.63 & 4.73/1.31 & 4.66/1.34 & 0.07 & 4.56/1.74 & 4.45/1.19 & 0.11 & 4.41/1.12 & 4.3/1.42 & 0.11 & 4.45/0.93 & 5.33/1.37 & -0.88 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 4.33/1.21 & 4/1.87 & 0.33 & 4.34/1.35 & 4.44/1.45 & -0.10 & 4.53/1.74 & 4.14/1.42 & 0.39 & 4.59/1.32 & 4.6/1.16 & -0.01 & 4.55/1.21 & 4.67/1.86 & -0.12 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 6.17/0.41 & 5.8/1.3 & 0.37 & 5.5/1.55 & 5.86/1.26 & -0.36 & 5.16/2.03 & 5.48/1.52 & -0.32 & 5.52/1.62 & 6.03/1.07 & -0.51 & 5.64/1.21 & 6.67/0.52 & -1.03 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 4.5/1.38 & 3.4/2.3 & 1.10 & 4.24/1.73 & 4.14/1.89 & 0.10 & 4.16/2.03 & 4.18/1.81 & -0.02 & 4.21/1.37 & 4.33/1.63 & -0.12 & 3.27/1.85 & 3.83/1.6 & -0.56 \\
