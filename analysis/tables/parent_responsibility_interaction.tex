I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 4.59/1.27 & 4.93/1.39 & -0.34 & 4.88/1.61 & 5.08/1.39 & -0.20 & 4.97/1.29 & 4.82/1.49 & 0.15 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 4.69/1.29 & 4.91/1.21 & -0.22 & 5.09/1.28 & 4.78/1.42 & 0.31 & 5/1.43 & 4.68/1.3 & 0.32 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 4/1.5 & 4.05/1.46 & -0.05 & 4.77/1.67 & 4.12/1.62 & 0.65 & 4.22/1.7 & 4.42/1.52 & -0.20 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 4.53/1.17 & 4.36/1.37 & 0.17 & 4.92/1.54 & 4.43/1.48 & 0.49 & 4.68/1.49 & 4.66/1.32 & 0.02 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 5.2/1.46 & 5.15/1.54 & 0.05 & 5.47/1.5 & 5.43/1.32 & 0.04 & 5.38/1.31 & 5.16/1.59 & 0.22 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 4.61/1.29 & 4.49/1.27 & 0.12 & 4.8/1.52 & 4.48/1.4 & 0.32 & 4.55/1.15 & 4.45/1.27 & 0.10 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 4.27/1.3 & 4.13/1.5 & 0.14 & 4.72/1.36 & 4.17/1.51 & 0.55 & 4.62/1.41 & 4.55/1.25 & 0.07 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 5.67/1.33 & 5.65/1.35 & 0.02 & 5.59/1.72 & 5.6/1.55 & -0.01 & 6.05/1.13 & 5.39/1.48 & 0.66 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 3.82/1.59 & 3.93/1.83 & -0.11 & 4.56/1.72 & 4.22/2.12 & 0.34 & 4.2/1.52 & 3.97/1.59 & 0.23 \\
