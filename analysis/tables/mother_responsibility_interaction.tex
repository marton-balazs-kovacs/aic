I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 4.51/1.29 & 4.82/1.37 & -0.31 & 5.06/1.65 & 5.42/1.38 & -0.36 & 4.88/1.34 & 4.57/1.44 & 0.31 & 4.62/1.06 & 4.2/1.3 & 0.42 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 4.66/1.24 & 4.85/1.21 & -0.19 & 5.18/1.37 & 5.08/1.38 & 0.10 & 5.22/1.24 & 4.57/1.2 & 0.65 & 4.12/1.55 & 3.6/1.14 & 0.52 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 3.9/1.54 & 3.9/1.44 & 0.00 & 4.89/1.74 & 4.49/1.69 & 0.40 & 4.66/1.49 & 4.48/1.47 & 0.18 & 3.38/1.51 & 3.6/0.55 & -0.22 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 4.41/1.22 & 4.19/1.36 & 0.22 & 5.08/1.53 & 4.85/1.45 & 0.23 & 4.88/1.36 & 4.39/1.37 & 0.49 & 4.12/1.89 & 4.8/0.84 & -0.68 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 5.02/1.47 & 5.16/1.45 & -0.14 & 5.66/1.49 & 5.72/1.34 & -0.06 & 5.62/1.13 & 5.09/1.38 & 0.53 & 4.75/1.39 & 3.8/1.64 & 0.95 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 4.51/1.33 & 4.28/1.29 & 0.23 & 4.89/1.47 & 4.81/1.43 & 0.08 & 4.78/1.29 & 4.48/1.04 & 0.30 & 3.88/0.99 & 3.8/0.84 & 0.08 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 4.34/1.35 & 3.93/1.42 & 0.41 & 4.65/1.4 & 4.68/1.52 & -0.03 & 4.81/1.38 & 4.3/1.22 & 0.51 & 4.25/1.16 & 4/1 & 0.25 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 5.59/1.34 & 5.53/1.46 & 0.06 & 5.65/1.79 & 5.87/1.43 & -0.22 & 6.16/1.08 & 5.43/1.31 & 0.73 & 5.25/1.16 & 4/1.87 & 1.25 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 3.88/1.61 & 3.76/1.84 & 0.12 & 4.53/1.81 & 4.58/1.97 & -0.05 & 4.41/1.32 & 3.83/1.75 & 0.58 & 4/1.85 & 4/1.41 & 0.00 \\
