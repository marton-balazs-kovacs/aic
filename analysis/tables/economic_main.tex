I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 5.3/1.06 & 4.87/1.43 & 4.92/1.49 & 0.38 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 4.2/1.69 & 4.89/1.29 & 4.97/1.4 & -0.77 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 3.5/1.58 & 4.28/1.61 & 4.56/1.52 & -1.06 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 3.7/1.49 & 4.62/1.43 & 4.74/1.29 & -1.04 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 5/1.33 & 5.32/1.44 & 5.38/1.62 & -0.38 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 3.8/1.69 & 4.63/1.32 & 4.49/1.39 & -0.69 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 3.6/1.51 & 4.39/1.4 & 4.77/1.4 & -1.17 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 5.1/1.2 & 5.64/1.46 & 5.87/1.59 & -0.77 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 3.1/1.73 & 4.14/1.77 & 4.51/1.7 & -1.41 \\
