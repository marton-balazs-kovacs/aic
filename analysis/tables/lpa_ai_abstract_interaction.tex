I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 5.05/1.59 & 4.7/1.35 & 0.35 & 4.94/1.18 & 4.56/1.03 & 0.38 & 4.88/1.51 & 4.85/1.58 & 0.03 & 4.89/1.36 & 5/1.47 & -0.11 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 5.03/1.2 & 4.77/1.41 & 0.26 & 4.94/1.18 & 5/0.73 & -0.06 & 4.56/1.37 & 5.12/1.2 & -0.56 & 4.69/1.46 & 5.03/1.35 & -0.34 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 4.55/1.67 & 4.35/1.57 & 0.20 & 4.38/1.2 & 3.81/1.56 & 0.57 & 3.94/1.5 & 4.53/1.83 & -0.59 & 4.27/1.51 & 4.27/1.68 & 0.00 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 4.82/1.41 & 4.7/1.41 & 0.12 & 4.44/1.03 & 4.44/1.31 & 0.00 & 4.59/1.35 & 4.9/1.45 & -0.31 & 4.47/1.46 & 4.48/1.53 & -0.01 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 5/1.72 & 5.28/1.1 & -0.28 & 5.25/1.39 & 5.25/1.65 & 0.00 & 5.24/1.63 & 5.42/1.45 & -0.18 & 5.39/1.43 & 5.45/1.42 & -0.06 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 4.84/1.59 & 4.4/1.22 & 0.44 & 4.62/1.31 & 4.69/1.01 & -0.07 & 4.41/1.33 & 4.9/1.35 & -0.49 & 4.59/1.24 & 4.41/1.44 & 0.18 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 4.84/1.24 & 4.28/1.44 & 0.56 & 4.06/1.61 & 4.5/1.32 & -0.44 & 4.41/1.46 & 4.68/1.4 & -0.27 & 4.31/1.4 & 4.24/1.44 & 0.07 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 5.05/1.83 & 5.53/1.37 & -0.48 & 5.44/1.79 & 5.88/1.09 & -0.44 & 5.47/1.56 & 5.9/1.45 & -0.43 & 5.72/1.46 & 5.94/1.2 & -0.22 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 4.37/1.62 & 3.98/1.63 & 0.39 & 3.69/1.78 & 3.5/2.03 & 0.19 & 4.53/1.48 & 4.7/1.6 & -0.17 & 3.95/1.88 & 4.09/1.94 & -0.14 \\
