I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 4.75/1.28 & 4.79/1.4 & -0.04 & 5.2/1.43 & 4.76/1.57 & 0.44 & 4.72/1.55 & 5.08/1.17 & -0.36 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 4.73/1.23 & 4.88/1.27 & -0.15 & 4.86/1.38 & 5.04/1.31 & -0.18 & 4.68/1.46 & 5.03/1.26 & -0.35 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 3.92/1.38 & 4.12/1.55 & -0.20 & 4.53/1.59 & 4.44/1.75 & 0.09 & 4.3/1.52 & 4.34/1.71 & -0.04 \\

According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 5.04/1.56 & 5.29/1.45 & -0.25 & 5.36/1.59 & 5.54/1.25 & -0.18 & 5.3/1.47 & 5.24/1.44 & 0.06 \\

If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 4.15/1.38 & 4.23/1.44 & -0.08 & 4.52/1.48 & 4.44/1.43 & 0.08 & 4.68/1.29 & 4.5/1.37 & 0.18 \\
