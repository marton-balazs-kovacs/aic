I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 4.89/1.64 & 4.82/1.22 & 0.07 & 4.68/1.16 & 4.85/1.07 & -0.17 & 4.74/1.47 & 5.03/1.64 & -0.29 & 4.85/1.35 & 5.01/1.46 & -0.16 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 5.26/1.28 & 4.38/1.21 & 0.88 & 5.11/0.81 & 4.77/1.17 & 0.34 & 4.79/1.23 & 4.97/1.43 & -0.18 & 4.76/1.54 & 4.93/1.31 & -0.17 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 4.81/1.71 & 3.94/1.32 & 0.87 & 4/1.37 & 4.23/1.48 & -0.23 & 4.42/1.55 & 4.03/1.89 & 0.39 & 4.2/1.75 & 4.32/1.48 & -0.12 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 5.19/1.31 & 4.15/1.31 & 1.04 & 4.47/1.07 & 4.38/1.33 & 0.09 & 4.77/1.48 & 4.74/1.32 & 0.03 & 4.44/1.52 & 4.51/1.47 & -0.07 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 5.26/1.51 & 5/1.3 & 0.26 & 5.63/1.07 & 4.69/1.89 & 0.94 & 5.33/1.48 & 5.35/1.62 & -0.02 & 5.4/1.49 & 5.44/1.38 & -0.04 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 4.96/1.41 & 4.12/1.27 & 0.84 & 4.79/1.32 & 4.46/0.88 & 0.33 & 4.58/1.3 & 4.81/1.45 & -0.23 & 4.49/1.39 & 4.51/1.32 & -0.02 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 4.77/1.39 & 4.24/1.3 & 0.53 & 4.63/1.38 & 3.77/1.48 & 0.86 & 4.72/1.22 & 4.32/1.66 & 0.40 & 4.24/1.41 & 4.31/1.42 & -0.07 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 5.47/1.6 & 5.09/1.62 & 0.38 & 6.05/1.08 & 5.08/1.8 & 0.97 & 5.79/1.47 & 5.58/1.57 & 0.21 & 5.78/1.51 & 5.87/1.2 & -0.09 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 4.32/1.64 & 3.94/1.59 & 0.38 & 3.63/1.83 & 3.54/2.03 & 0.09 & 4.58/1.42 & 4.68/1.72 & -0.10 & 4.15/1.75 & 3.93/2.02 & 0.22 \\
