I believe the research results described in the summary are unreliable. & 5/1.15 & 5.25/2.06 & -0.25 & 4.82/1.37 & 5.03/1.37 & -0.21 & 4.69/1.75 & 4.88/1.37 & -0.19 & 5.03/1.25 & 4.79/1.47 & 0.24 & 4.5/1.41 & 5.11/1.69 & -0.61 \\ 
The conclusions drawn in the summary seem well-founded based on the methodology described there. & 5.57/0.98 & 4.5/2.08 & 1.07 & 4.77/1.34 & 4.94/1.26 & -0.17 & 5.19/1.21 & 4.68/1.32 & 0.51 & 5/1.49 & 4.52/1.38 & 0.48 & 4.75/1.28 & 5.22/1.09 & -0.47 \\ 
I would be willing to reference the presented results in discussions related to the topic based on the summary. & 4.86/0.69 & 4/2.45 & 0.86 & 4.35/1.65 & 4.21/1.5 & 0.14 & 4.62/1.77 & 3.85/1.52 & 0.77 & 4.27/1.7 & 4.1/1.5 & 0.17 & 4/1.69 & 5.33/1.32 & -1.33 \\ 
I trust the accuracy of the results reported in the summary. & 5/0.82 & 4/2.16 & 1.00 & 4.77/1.35 & 4.52/1.36 & 0.25 & 4.81/1.63 & 4.24/1.42 & 0.57 & 4.67/1.49 & 4.41/1.35 & 0.26 & 4.25/1.49 & 5.22/1.39 & -0.97 \\ 
According to the summary, this research does not provide valuable information on reducing adolescent obesity. & 4.71/1.5 & 5/2.45 & -0.29 & 5.39/1.51 & 5.32/1.43 & 0.07 & 5.38/1.43 & 5.12/1.34 & 0.26 & 5.63/1.22 & 5.17/1.63 & 0.46 & 4.62/1.51 & 5.67/1.5 & -1.05 \\ 
The study appears to have been conducted consistently and with great care by the researchers. & 5/1 & 3.75/2.36 & 1.25 & 4.71/1.44 & 4.68/1.2 & 0.03 & 4.69/1.49 & 4.26/1.36 & 0.43 & 4.53/1.22 & 4.17/1.31 & 0.36 & 4.62/0.74 & 4.89/1.45 & -0.27 \\ 
If other researchers were to re-examine the exact same question, they would likely find the intervention equally effective. & 4.29/1.11 & 4/2.16 & 0.29 & 4.53/1.3 & 4.25/1.48 & 0.28 & 4.62/1.59 & 3.91/1.46 & 0.71 & 4.67/1.3 & 4.52/1.18 & 0.15 & 4.38/1.3 & 4.78/1.56 & -0.40 \\ 
If I had a child of this age, I would not allow this program to be implemented in their school. & 6/0.58 & 6/1.41 & 0.00 & 5.69/1.42 & 5.69/1.42 & 0.00 & 5.4/1.89 & 5.26/1.58 & 0.14 & 6.2/1.1 & 5.34/1.52 & 0.86 & 5.75/1.28 & 6.22/0.97 & -0.47 \\ 
I support legally mandating the introduction of these obesity-reducing methods in schools based on this article. & 4.29/1.38 & 3.5/2.65 & 0.79 & 4.14/1.7 & 4.23/1.93 & -0.09 & 4.52/1.73 & 3.74/2.02 & 0.78 & 4.43/1.41 & 4.1/1.59 & 0.33 & 3.12/1.73 & 3.78/1.79 & -0.66 \\
